# notes
Public domain, often reverse-engineered documentation of software utilized by the Minecraft PvP community. Focuses include: Lunar Client, Mantle, Mixin tutorials, idea proposals, and more.

You can view the pages with rich formatting and metadata [here](https://tomat.dev/projects/uranometrical-notes/home). See the bleeding-edge information [here](https://konata.tomat.dev/projects/mc/notes/en/home), alternatively (until I merge my website's rewrite upstream).
