~~You're looking for the [wiki](https://github.com/Uranometrical/notes/wiki).~~ While the GitHub wiki can still be used to browse, official support is no longer supported and we do not publish updates to the GitHub wiki. Please instead head over to [my website](https://tomat.dev/projects/uranometrical-notes/home), which offers rich formatting and YAML metadata support in Markdown, giving the end-user a better and more comprehensive experience.
