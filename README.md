# notes
Public domain, reverse-engineered documentation of Minecraft-related projects, mainly in relation to the PvP community. Things focused on here include Lunar Client, Mantle, tutorials in relation to mixins/distribtuon, proposals, and more.\

Originally this was hosted on the GitHub repository's wiki, but it has since been moved to [my website](https://tomat.dev/projects/uranometrical-notes/home) in order to make use of richer formatting and YAML metadata.
