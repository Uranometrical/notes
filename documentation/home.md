### Why?
You may find yourself asking "what purpose does this serve?" or "how is this beneficial?". To keep it short, we aim to provide this information to further push for compatibility and compliance in the community. We hope that by putting in the effort to put this information out in the open, it will encourage others to implement certain features that enable compatibility with other Pvp clients, create open-source reimplementations of proprietary or closed-source software, etc.
