### Purpose
To keep it short, we aim to provide this information to further push for compatibility and compliance in the community. We hope that by putting in the effort to put this information out in the open, it will encourage others to implement certain features that enable compatibility with other PvP clients, create open-source reimplementations of proprietary or closed-source software, etc. In an optimistic world, it may even encourage developers to open-source their software or at least contribute information.
